# cudaSLAM
Simultaneous Localization And Mapping using lidar and CUDA

This library is a work in progress and was started as an alternative to hector_slam and gmapping modules in ROS because I had so much trouble
getting those libraries to work well. I've also been tinkering with Nvidia's Xavier and Jetson Nano boards so this gave me a good project to
use CUDA with.
